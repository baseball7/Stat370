## Loops and Conditionals

This assignment looks at the functions “rnorm()” and “dnorm()”. The first gives a random number with Normal distribution and the second gives the probability density function (whose graph is the density curve) for the Normal distribution (i.e. a perfect bell curve).
These will implement the Normal distribution with the important difference that it will be impossible for the random variable to be a negative number—when a negative number appears, new random numbers are chosen, until a positive one appears.

##rmytnorm

```{r someVar, echo=FALSE}
rmytnorm <- function(n=1, m=0) {
  v <- rep(NA, n)
  for(i in 1:n) {
    v[i] <- -1
    while(v[i]<0) {
      v[i] <- rnorm(1, mean=m)
    }
  }
  return(v)
  
}
dmytnorm <- function(x, m=0) {
  v <- rep(NA, length(x))
  for(i in 1:length(x)) {
    
  if(x[i]<0) {
    v[i] <- 0
  }else {
    v[i] <- 2*dnorm(x[i], mean=m)
  }
  }
  return(v)
  }


```

```{r}


y <- rmytnorm(1000,10)

head(y)
hist(y)

```


## dmytnorm



```{r}
x <- dmytnorm(-10:10,5)

head(x)
plot(x)
```
